# üìú Deploying Elasticsearch on Kubernetes
Welcome to the second lab of our hands-on course, "Learn by Doing - EFK Stack"! üéâ In this lab, we'll guide you through the process of deploying Elasticsearch within a Kubernetes cluster. We'll cover setting up a StatefulSet for Elasticsearch, configuring Persistent Volumes for data storage, and using Services for network access. Each section builds upon the last, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of deploying Elasticsearch in a Kubernetes environment. üìö

# ü§î Understanding Kubernetes and Elasticsearch
Before diving into the deployment process, let's quickly recap the basics of Kubernetes and Elasticsearch.

## Kubernetes Overview
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Elasticsearch Overview
Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and real-time search. It's commonly used for log or event data analysis and full-text search.
Using Elasticsearch in conjunction with Kubernetes, allows it to reap benefits from Kubernetes' self-healing and scalability features.

# üè∞ Setting Up a StatefulSet for Elasticsearch
StatefulSets are ideal for stateful applications like Elasticsearch. They provide stable, unique network identifiers and persistent storage for each pod.

## Why Use StatefulSet?
Stable Network Identity: Each pod gets a unique and stable hostname.
Ordered, Graceful Deployment and Scaling: Pods are created and deleted in a predictable order.
Persistent Storage: Each pod can be associated with its storage, which persists across pod rescheduling.
## Creating a StatefulSet
Below is a basic example of a StatefulSet definition for Elasticsearch. Note that you should adjust values such as volumeClaimTemplates according to your environment and needs.
``` yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch
spec:
  serviceName: "elasticsearch"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: elasticsearch
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: elasticsearch
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: elasticsearch
        image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.9.3
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9200
          name: es-http
        volumeMounts:
        - name: es-data
          mountPath: /usr/share/elasticsearch/data
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: es-data
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
```
This YAML file defines a StatefulSet named elasticsearch with three replicas. It specifies the use of the Elasticsearch 7.9.3 Docker image and a persistent volume claim for data storage.

# üíæ Configuring Persistent Volumes for Data Storage
Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are critical in managing storage in Kubernetes.

## Understanding PVs and PVCs
Persistent Volume (PV): Represents a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.
Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): A request for storage by a user. It specifies size, and access modes, and can be linked to specific PVs.
### Example: Persistent Volume Claim
The volumeClaimTemplates section in the StatefulSet YAML file automatically creates a PVC for each pod in the StatefulSet. Here's what happens behind the scenes:
``` yaml
volumeClaimTemplates:
- metadata:
    name: es-data
  spec:
    accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
```
This configuration requests a 10Gi volume with ReadWriteOnce access mode for each Elasticsearch pod. The Kubernetes cluster automatically provisions this storage if dynamic provisioning is set up or binds the PVC to a manually created PV.

# üåê Using Services for Network Access
Services in Kubernetes provide a way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

## Why Services?
Stable IP Addresses: Services provide stable IP addresses for pods.
Load Balancing: Services can load-balance traffic to multiple pods.
Service Discovery: Services allow other applications to discover and communicate with your Elasticsearch cluster through a stable endpoint.
Creating a Service for Elasticsearch
Here's an example of a Service definition for Elasticsearch. This service exposes the Elasticsearch HTTP port (9200) so that other applications can communicate with the cluster.

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch
spec:
  selector:
    app: elasticsearch
  ports:
  - port: 9200
    targetPort: es-http
  type: ClusterIP
```
This YAML file creates a Service named elasticsearch, which targets pods with the label app: elasticsearch. It makes the Elasticsearch HTTP API accessible within the cluster through the cluster IP of the Service.

# üéâ Conclusion
Deploying Elasticsearch on Kubernetes involves setting up a StatefulSet for stable pod identification and storage, configuring Persistent Volumes for data persistence, and using Services for stable network access. By following these steps, you can ensure a resilient and scalable Elasticsearch cluster within your Kubernetes environment. This guide aimed to provide a beginner-friendly introduction to deploying Elasticsearch on Kubernetes, covering the essential components and configurations.

How does Kibana connect to Elasticsearch?

Create a deployment for kibana in the elastic-stack namespace.
Use the following specs:
name: kibana
label: kibana
replicas: 1
image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.1.0
containerPort: 5601

A: 

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kibana
  namespace: elastic-stack
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kibana
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kibana
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kibana
        image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5601

Now, letâ€™s verify that the kibana pod is running successfully.
A: kubectl get pods.

Now, Expose kibana through  Kubernetes Service of type NodePort in the elastic-stack namespace.
Name the service as kibana

*Ensure Service type is set to NodePort and the default kibana port 5601 is mapped to nodePort 30601.

A: 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kibana
  namespace: elastic-stack
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: kibana
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 5601
    nodePort: 30601

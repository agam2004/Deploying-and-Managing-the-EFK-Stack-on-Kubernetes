Advanced Configuration for EFK

# üìú Advanced Configurations for Optimizing the EFK Stack on Kubernetes
In this guide, we will explore how to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack on Kubernetes. This includes diving into custom Fluentd plugins for log enrichment and Elasticsearch index management strategies for performance optimization. Our goal is to provide you with a comprehensive understanding and practical skills to improve your EFK stack.
# üïÆ Introduction to the EFK Stack
The EFK stack combines Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana to efficiently manage, search, and visualize logs generated by applications running in Kubernetes clusters.
Elasticsearch acts as a highly scalable search and analytics engine.
Fluentd serves as an open-source data collector for unified logging, allowing you to unify data collection and consumption for better use and understanding of data.
Kibana provides the visualization layer, offering powerful and user-friendly interfaces to view and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch.

# üîñ Custom Fluentd Plugins for Log Enrichment
Log enrichment involves adding additional context to your logs, making them more informative and easier to analyze. Custom Fluentd plugins can be developed or configured to enrich logs with extra metadata, such as Kubernetes labels, environment information, or application-specific data.
Creating a Custom Fluentd Filter Plugin
Set up your Fluentd environment: Ensure you have Fluentd installed and running in your Kubernetes cluster. You can use the Fluentd daemonset for easy deployment.
Develop the plugin: Fluentd plugins are typically written in Ruby. Here's a simple example of a custom filter plugin that adds a static field to all logs:
require 'fluent/plugin/filter'

module Fluent::Plugin
  class MyCustomFilter < Filter
    Fluent::Plugin.register_filter('my_custom_filter', self)

    def configure(conf)
      super
      # You can add configuration parameters here
    end

    def filter(tag, time, record)
      # Add a custom field to the record
      record["additional_info"] = "static_value"
      record
    end
  end
end

## Install the plugin: After developing your plugin, you need to make it available to Fluentd. If you package it as a gem, you can install it using Fluentd's fluent-gem command.
Configure Fluentd to use the plugin: Modify your Fluentd configuration to use the new filter. Here's an example configuration snippet:
<filter **>
  @type my_custom_filter
</filter>

## The plugin that you see above is the filter plugin. It is used to modify the structure of a log message. We are using it here in conjunction with our custom plugin that adds a new field to the logs.
Another important plugin that Fluentd uses is the buffer plugin which temporarily stores logs before forwarding them to the destination. It, thereby, helps in avoiding data loss.
Testing and Debugging
Ensure to test your plugin thoroughly in a development environment before deploying it to production. Fluentd provides detailed logs that can help you debug issues with your custom plugins.
# üß∞ Elasticsearch Index Management for Performance
Proper index management is crucial for maintaining the performance of your Elasticsearch cluster. This involves strategies such as index rollover, sharding, and replicas configuration.
Index Rollover
Index rollover helps in managing indices based on certain criteria like size, age, or document count. It allows you to automate the creation of new indices when the current ones meet specified conditions.
Create an index template:
PUT _template/my_logs_template
{
  "index_patterns": ["logs-*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3,
    "number_of_replicas": 1
  }
}

Set up an ILM (Index Lifecycle Management) policy:
PUT _ilm/policy/my_logs_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_size": "5GB",
            "max_age": "30d"
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "90d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

## Apply the ILM policy to your index template:
PUT _template/my_logs_template
{
  "settings": {
    "index.lifecycle.name": "my_logs_policy"
  }
}

## Sharding and Replicas Configuration
Properly configuring shards and replicas can significantly impact your Elasticsearch cluster's performance and resilience.
Shards: Distribute data across multiple nodes in the cluster to improve performance. The minimum value of master-eligible ELasticsearch nodes in a cluster is 3 to ensure high availability. The optimal number of shards depends on the size of your data and the capacity of your nodes.
Replicas: Provide high availability and redundancy. In case of a node failure, replicas ensure that your data is not lost.
PUT /my_logs-000001
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 3, 
      "number_of_replicas": 2 
    }
  }
}

Apart from the above configurations, changing the refresh interval for an Elasticsearch index is another vital setting for improving write performance in an environment with intense log load.
# üéâ Conclusion
Optimizing the EFK stack on Kubernetes involves a combination of custom log enrichment and efficient Elasticsearch index management. By developing custom Fluentd plugins, you can enhance the quality and usefulness of your logs. Meanwhile, proper index management strategies like rollover, sharding, and replicas configuration help maintain Elasticsearch performance at scale. With these advanced configurations, you can significantly improve your logging infrastructure's efficiency and reliability.
